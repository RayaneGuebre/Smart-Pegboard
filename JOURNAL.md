 Guess what? I forgot to start the journal AGAIN, and so now I'm kinda late but still better late than never :D

Dear Future Highway reviewer, please have some mercy on me, I just have a seriously terrible memory.

## Day 1 
(future rayane: I forgot to journal even that day)

The design is almost complete, BUT, I've some problems designing the mechanism to pick objects. I decided to try with a rack gear, but I can't design them on Fusion 360 online. I'm gonna see if there is any model on GrabCAD that I can scale.
 Research: 30m

i don't know how many days i forgot to log but here i am, today i almost finished the design, so i started the code and so far so good, i coded the algoritmh to set it up and the one to send it to a specific unit, now i need to calculate how to center the center of th unit to the "grabber", i'm probably going to calculate how many steps equal to the unit width and then from it find how many mm is a step, and from there it's should all be in downhill, except for the part where i'l have to connect it to a rasberry pi, it should be too hard but idk

so, today i added the magnets to the "units" (i still don't know how to call them), i'm gonna try with some small ones and see if they works, then i also added the two board, the arduino and the rasberry pi 5 ( i may change it to a zero 2w to reduce the cost if needed) using a standoff, heat inserts and screws, i also make space to insert the stepper motor horiwontaly so there is no need to print two separates parts and u can simply slide it in, i also made it a little smaller to have a bit on the rail. and i started preparing the bom, tomorrow i'm gonna turn it into a csv file and then if everything oges on well ship it to highsea

BOM, Research, Designing : 8h
