Guess what? I forgot to start the journal AGAIN, and so now I'm kinda late but still better late than never :D

Dear Future Highway reviewer, please have some mercy on me, I just have a seriously terrible memory.

## Day 1 
(future rayane: I forgot to journal even that day)
## 18 / 07
The design is almost complete, BUT, I've some problems designing the mechanism to pick objects. I decided to try with a rack gear, but I can't design them on Fusion 360 online. I'm gonna see if there is any model on GrabCAD that I can scale.
 Research: 30m

i don't know how many days i forgot to log but here i am, today i almost finished the design, so i started the code and so far so good, i coded the algoritmh to set it up and the one to send it to a specific unit, now i need to calculate how to center the center of th unit to the "grabber", i'm probably going to calculate how many steps equal to the unit width and then from it find how many mm is a step, and from there it's should all be in downhill, except for the part where i'l have to connect it to a rasberry pi, it should be too hard but idk
