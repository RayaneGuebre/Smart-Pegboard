  Guess what? I forgot to start the journal AGAIN, and so now I'm kinda late but still better late than never :D

Dear Future Highway reviewer, please have some mercy on me, I just have a seriously terrible memory.

today i started designing the "units for this pegboard, i decided to go 100mmX100mm so i've enough space for my larger tools as well, i still need to design the mechanism to attach the tools

## 28 / 06
today i started designing the mechanism to attach the tool, my goal is to attach them by rotating the tool holder and then make the "click" together

## 30 / 06
i started designing the complementar parts to attach all the ret together, right the top and bottom 3d printed part, and the one on the side, and the one that attaches each unit horizontally

## 02 / 07
i started designing the complete board with the two linear rails on the side, i decided to use a 8x8 pattern, i'm gonna use the corexy mechanism like with my last project, that i couldn't build because i din't have time to finish and ship it, but at least i learned a lot of things that i'm gonna apply on this project
<img src="blob:https://gmail3829496.autodesk360.com/023a11b8-36ac-4f62-a868-f36408c8bfa3"/><img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8506c3e6-bbcc-48a8-93d9-26f8f3794c77" />




## 06 / 07
sooo, i added the mounts that are going to connect the linear rails and the 2020 profile, and I also added the support for the idler pulleys

## 09 / 07
since there is not enough space for the 2020 profile i decided to rise the parts on the sides to leave a bit more psace, i also added the two pulleys on the linear rails to the design
<img width="234" height="202" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87833e6b-c696-4bcc-ab15-1e8ee3a27bfe" />

## 15 / 07
So today i started designignt the tools holders that has i said in a previous log, the plan is to attach them to the board by rotating them of 90 degrees and make them click together, i also started designing the piece that hold the "picker"
<img width="319" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26bb34a0-5d75-4fc7-aba9-6984103329e3" />

## 18 / 07
The design is almost complete, BUT, I've some problems designing the mechanism to pick objects. I decided to try with a rack gear, but I can't design them on Fusion 360 online. I'm gonna see if there is any model on GrabCAD that I can scale.
 Research: 30m
## 20 / 07
so, today i finished designing the "picker", i decided to use magnets in the gear because i can't actually design gears in fuion360, so i had to get creative and decided to use magnets, and i think that it is technically going to work. i also started designing the part that's gonna hold the stepper motors, and i'm pretty confident that√¨s gonna work well.

designing and researching: 6h

## 24 / 07
Today i didn't advanced much, i just added the holes for the screws on the linear rails mounts

Designing: 2h

## 25 / 07
Today i finished the part that's gonna hold the stepper motor part, and also added the limit switches to the end of each linear rail mount
designing: 3h

## 26 / 07
today i almost finished the design, so i started the code and so far so good, i coded the algoritmh to set it up and the one to send it to a specific unit, now i need to calculate how to center the center of th unit to the "grabber", i'm probably going to calculate how many steps equal to the unit width and then from it find how many mm is a step, and from there it's should all be in downhill, except for the part where i'l have to connect it to a rasberry pi, it should be too hard but idk

## 28 / 07
today i added the t-slot nuts to the design, i decided to skip the screws since i couldn't find the same model i was using

## 29 / 07

today i almost finished the designg, i added the upport for the limit switch that are gonna get screwed in with M2.5 screws, i've already added the holes for the heat inserts o it's easier to screw them in 
<img width="49" height="45" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d72e17-05a0-408f-8d37-326a6d45633c" />
Designing: 1h
## 30 / 07
so, today i added the magnets to the "units" (i still don't know how to call them), i'm gonna try with some small ones and see if they works, then i also added the two board, the arduino and the rasberry pi 5 ( i may change it to a zero 2w to reduce the cost if needed) using a standoff, heat inserts and screws, i also make space to insert the stepper motor horiwontaly so there is no need to print two separates parts and u can simply slide it in, i also made it a little smaller to have a bit on the rail. and i started preparing the bom, tomorrow i'm gonna turn it into a csv file, i'm also gonna improve this journal through the various saves i have on fusion360 and then if everything goes on well ship it to highsea

BOM, Research, Designing: 8h
